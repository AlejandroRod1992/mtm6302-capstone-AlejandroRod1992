        <p class="desc-text"><strong> Explanation: </strong> What do the famous Eagle Nebula star pillars look like in X-ray light?
To find out, NASA's orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory peered in and through these interstellar 
mountains of star formation. It was found that in M16 the dust pillars themselves do not emit many
X-rays, but a lot of small-but-bright X-ray sources became evident.
These sources are shown as bright dots on the featured image which is a composite of exposures from 
Chandra (X-rays), XMM
(X-rays), JWST (infrared), Spitzer (infrared), Hubble (visible), and the VLT (visible). What stars 
produce these X-rays remains a topic of re- search, but some are hypothesized to be hot, 
recently-formed,
low-mass stars, while others are thought to be hot, older, high-mass stars. These X-ray hot stars 
are scattered around the frame -- the previously identified Evaporating Gaseous Globules (EGGS) 
seen in
visible light are not currently hot enough to emit X-rays.
