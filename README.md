Design Desicions Report:


-We opted for a dark color scheme for our website to enhance the visual impact of the images displayed. Using dark backgrounds allows the images to stand out and captivate the user's attention immediately.
-One of our primary design goals was to ensure a simple and user-friendly navigation experience for the Web version we have a navigation bar on the top of the page and for the mobile, we opted to go for a hamburger menu with the 2 options for Menu and for Favorites. 
To like a photo, you will click on the heart for the Desktop and double click the photo for the mobile version This will make the heart red and add it to the favorites to de-select from favorites double tap or click on the red heart again.
-In our design process, we prioritized user accessibility. We ensured that text and interactive elements were easy to read and interact with the font that we used is Barbel fill for the titles and Minion Variable Concept for the paragraphs.
